# CSS Library

The CSS Library I have put together includes 3 separate pieces: Reset, Common, Media

##Basics

  **Reset**
    
    The reset file is used to strip away most (v1 People) default styles set by a browser.
    
  **Common**
    
    The common file re-adds some default styling to maintain *expected* behavior. Some standard class
    styles are also added in the common file for quick *common* styling.
    
  **Media**
    
    The media file changes certain styling depending on the pixel width of the screen. As of now (v1)
    this only affects text size.
